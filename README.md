# Onboard-Neopixel

We're creating our first program for the Adafruit Feather TFT esp32-s3.   This will control onboard NeoPixel (and technically, any connected WS2812B LED strips) - we walk through how to find the code, and do very little coding ourself.  

This has a Youbube video showing how to code this: https://youtu.be/ERq-zMW76K8
